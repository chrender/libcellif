Description: Interface translating libfizmo output into monospaced text
 This interface will translate all Z-Machine output, including window
 operations and text output, into simple place-cursor-at-x-y-and-print-text
 events, which in turn can be used for simple ncurses-like output on
 terminal-like displays. This is used by the fizmo-ncursesw frontend.
