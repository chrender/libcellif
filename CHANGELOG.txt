   Version 0.7.0

 + The "libcellif" interface has been developed out of fizmo's ncursesw
   interface in version 0.6. It assumes that the screen is up of fixed-width
   charachter cells -- like a standard terminal -- and translates all the
   Z-Machine output operations into "goto-xy", "print" and similar
   commands. That menas it's possible to implement a cell-based interface
   without having to worry about window resizes or other Z-Machine related
   concepts.
 - The "fizmo-ncurses" interface relies on this library for output.
