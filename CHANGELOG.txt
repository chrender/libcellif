   Version 0.7.6
 + 0.7.6 was finished at about Thu Dec 27 21:35:34 CET 2012.
 - Minor fix for libcell build target.

   Version 0.7.5
 + 0.7.5 was finished at about Fri Nov 30 14:02:28 CET 2012.
 - Implemented delete in read_line and read_char.
 - CTRL-R will now redraw the screen. Contrary to CTRL-L, which refreshes
   the screen based on the current layout, CTRL-R will reconstruct the
   latest output based on the output history. This will help to display
   output which is hidden in case a game clears the screen, writes some
   text into the top line and then turns on the score line which then
   overlays the topmost line.
 - Adapted to new command history interface.

   Version 0.7.4
 + 0.7.4 was finished at about Mon Sep 17 22:14:52 CEST 2012.
 - Adapted to new autoconf(automake build system.

   Version 0.7.3
 + 0.7.3 was finished at about Wed Aug 1 21:42:17 CEST 2012.
 - Merged Andrew Plotkin's iOS-fizmo changes: Adapted to new function
  "prompt_for_filename" in screen-interface.
 - Fixed screen interface invocation to not use timeout if not actually
   required by the game.

   Version 0.7.2
 + 0.7.2 was finished at about Fri Mar 9 21:01:12 CET 2012.
 - Fixed missing $(DESTDIR) variable -- should already have been present
   since version 0.7.1.

   Version 0.7.1
 + 0.7.1 was finished at about Sun Nov 6 22:44:17 CET 2011.
 - Fixed missing "override" statments for CFLAGS in Makefiles.
 - Fixed $(DESTDIR) evaluation in config.[default|macports].mk.
 - Adapted Makefiles and configuration to use standard GNU Makefile variables
   instead of INSTALL_PATH and FIZMO_BIN_DIR.

   Version 0.7.0
 + 0.7.0 was finished at about Sun Sep 18 08:41:18 CEST 2011
 + The "libcellif" interface has been developed out of fizmo's ncursesw
   interface in version 0.6. It assumes that the screen is up of fixed-width
   charachter cells -- like a standard terminal -- and translates all the
   Z-Machine output operations into "goto-xy", "print" and similar
   commands. That menas it's possible to implement a cell-based interface
   without having to worry about window resizes or other Z-Machine related
   concepts.
 - The "fizmo-ncurses" interface relies on this library for output.
